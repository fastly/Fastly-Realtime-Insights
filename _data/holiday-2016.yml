          <h3>Shopify</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.shopify.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a> is the leading cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform designed for small and medium-sized businesses, and <a href="https://www.fastly.com/customers/shopify">we’re pleased to count them among our ecommerce customers<a/>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shopify powers many of the top online sites, including major brands such as Tesla Motors, Red Bull, Nestle, GE, Kylie Jenner, and hundreds of thousands more, giving them a front-row seat for the holiday shopping surge. With that in mind, we worked with them to share how shoppers engaged online during this peak shopping season, comparing holiday traffic to the same time span a month prior (October 23-29).
