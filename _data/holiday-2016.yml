          <h3>Shopify</h3>
          <p>
            Shopify is the leading cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform
            designed for small and medium-sized businesses, and we’re pleased
            to count them among our ecommerce customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shopify powers many of the top online sites, including major brands
            such as Tesla Motors, Red Bull, Nestle, GE, Kylie Jenner, and
            hundreds of thousands more, giving them a front-row seat for the
            holiday shopping surge. With that in mind, we worked with them to
            share how shoppers engaged online during this peak shopping season.
            Here’s a timeline of what we saw:
