        <h3>Between Two Ferns with HRC</h3>
        <p>
          When Emmy Award-winning comedy website Funny Or Die aired their
          popular “Between Two Ferns” interview with Hillary Clinton, the video
          was viewed more than 30 million times in the first 24 hours,
          retweeted over 28,000 times, and they saw double the amount of
          traffic they had seen after airing the 2014 interview with
          Barack Obama.

              The Hillary Clinton campaign website is behind Fastly, which gave us
              unique visibility into the Democratic candidate’s site traffic
              patterns during the debate. Traffic to hillaryclinton.com surged
              during the debate as viewers reacted to both candidates, spiking most
              notably when viewers were first directed to Clinton’s website, with
              an increase of 4,600%.
